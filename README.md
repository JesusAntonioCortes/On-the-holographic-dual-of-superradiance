# On-the-holographic-dual-of-superradiance
Here you can find the numerical and analytical methods used in my master's thesis that have been implemented in readyto-be-used MathematicaÂ® notebooks, which are publicly available. In this work, I calculated the quasinormal modes of two different AdS-Black holes to study the superradiance instability.
